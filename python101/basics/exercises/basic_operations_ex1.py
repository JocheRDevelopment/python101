Exercise: Operators Practice

In this exercise, you will practice using different types of operators in Python. 
You will work with arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, identity, and membership operators.

Instructions:
1. Create two integer variables named 'a' and 'b'. Assign the values 15 and 4 to 'a' and 'b' respectively.
2. Perform all arithmetic operations between 'a' and 'b' and print the results with descriptive messages.
3. Use assignment operators to modify 'a' with 'b' and print the new value of 'a' after each operation.
4. Compare 'a' against 'b' with all comparison operators and print the results.
5. Use logical operators (and, or, not) using 'a' and 'b' and print the results.
6. Check the identity of two lists [1, 2, 3] and [1, 2, 3] and also check if they are equal.
7. Create a list named 'fruits' containing 'apple', 'banana', and 'cherry'. Use the membership operators to check if 'banana' and 'grape' are in 'fruits'.

Example output for arithmetic operation:
print("Addition (a + b):", a + b)

Make sure to print out the results of each operation as shown in the example above.

Note: Remember to include descriptive print statements to clearly indicate the operation and result.

# Expected output for arithmetic operations
Addition (a + b): 19
Subtraction (a - b): 11
Multiplication (a * b): 60
Division (a / b): 3.75
Modulus (a % b): 3
Exponentiation (a ** b): 50625
Floor Division (a // b): 3

# Expected output for assignment operations
After a += b, a = 19
After a -= b, a = 15
After a *= b, a = 60
After a /= b, a = 15.0
After a %= b, a = 3
After a **= b, a = 50625
After a //= b, a = 3

# Expected output for comparison operations
a == b: False
a != b: True
a > b: True
a < b: False
a >= b: True
a <= b: False

# Expected output for logical operations
(a > 10) and (b < 5): True
(a > 10) or (b > 5): True
not (a > 10): False

# Expected output for identity and equality operations
List1 is List2: False
List1 == List2: True

# Expected output for membership operations
'banana' in fruits: True
'grape' in fruits: False
