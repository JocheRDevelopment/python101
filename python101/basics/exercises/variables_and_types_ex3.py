Exercise 3: Type Conversion
Convert the 'height' variable to an integer, the 'age' variable to a float, and the 'is_student' variable to a string, and then print them out.

- Convert 'height' to an integer and store it in a variable named 'height_as_int'.
- Convert 'age' to a float and store it in a variable named 'age_as_float'.
- Convert 'is_student' to a string and store it in a variable named 'is_student_as_string'.
- Print out the converted variables.

Example of converting and printing a variable:
height_as_int = int(height)
print("Height as integer:", height_as_int)

Expected output:
Height as integer: 5
Age as float: 25.0
Is student as string: True

Hint: Use the int(), float(), and str() functions for type conversion. If you are running this file independently, make sure to declare and initialize 'age', 'height', and 'is_student' before doing the conversions.
