Exercise 2: Type Checking
Check the type of each variable created in Exercise 1 and print it out.

- Use the type() function to determine the type of the 'age', 'height', 'name', and 'is_student' variables.
- Print out the type of each variable.

Example of checking the type of a variable:
print("The type of age is:", type(age))

Expected output:
The type of age is: <class 'int'>
The type of height is: <class 'float'>
The type of name is: <class 'str'>
The type of is_student is: <class 'bool'>

Hint: Remember that you can reuse the variables from Exercise 1 if you have the file set up to run consecutively, or you will need to redeclare them in this exercise.
