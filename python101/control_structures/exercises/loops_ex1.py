Exercise: Loops Practice

In this exercise, you will use loops to iterate over sequences and to repeatedly execute code until a condition is met.

Instructions:
1. Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop and the `range()` function. Print each number inside the loop.
2. Using a `while` loop, initialize a variable 'count' to 0 and increment it until it reaches 5. Print the value of 'count' each time the loop runs.
3. Iterate over the list ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'] using a `for` loop. Use an `if` statement within the loop to print only 'banana'.
4. Use a `for` loop with a `break` statement: loop over the numbers from 1 to 10 and break the loop when the number is equal to 5. Print each number.
5. Use a `for` loop with a `continue` statement: loop over the numbers from 1 to 10 and skip the number 5 using `continue`. Print each number.
6. (Bonus) Use nested `for` loops to iterate over two lists ['red', 'big', 'tasty'] and ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'] to print out all possible combinations of the items.

Expected output:
For each loop task, the output should display the result of the looping logic as described above.

Example:
# Output for task 1
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
# Output for task 2
0
1
2
3
4
5
# Output for task 3
banana
# Output for task 4
1
2
3
4
# Output for task 5
1
2
3
4
6
7
8
9
10
# Output for task 6
red apple
red banana
red cherry
big apple
big banana
big cherry
tasty apple
tasty banana
tasty cherry

Remember to use print statements to display your results. Good luck!
