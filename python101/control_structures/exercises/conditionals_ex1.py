Exercise: Conditional Statements Practice

In this exercise, you will write conditional statements to check against various conditions and respond accordingly.

Instructions:
1. Create a variable named 'temperature' and set it to an integer value of your choice.
2. Write a conditional statement to print "It's a hot day" if the temperature is greater than 30.
3. Write a conditional statement to print "It's a nice day" if the temperature is greater than 20 but at or below 30.
4. Write a conditional statement to print "It's a bit chilly" if the temperature is greater than 10 but at or below 20.
5. Write a conditional statement to print "It's cold!" if the temperature is 10 or below.
6. After writing these conditions, test your program with different values for 'temperature'.

Expected output (depending on the value of 'temperature'):
"It's a hot day" (if temperature > 30)
"It's a nice day" (if 20 < temperature <= 30)
"It's a bit chilly" (if 10 < temperature <= 20)
"It's cold!" (if temperature <= 10)

Hint: Make sure to order and structure your conditions properly! 
For this exercise, you will need to use if, elif, and else statements to handle different ranges of temperature.
